# Logistic Regression

## Goals
* Learn how to read a dataset, to visualize it in different ways, to select and clean unnecessary information from your data.
* Implement one-vs-all logistic regression that will solve classification problem

We are given a dataset, consisting of 1600 Hogwarts students's various characteristics (i.e their grades in all classes, birth date, names, etc..) and their House. It's a classification problem, the goal is to train a model that will be able to predict a student's House, among the 4 Hogwarts Houses, from his characteristics.

The assignment has multiple parts: first we must visualise our data, to help us clean it and select the useful characteristics for our training. Then we can train our model on the dataset in _dataset_train.csv_, and finally, we can use it to predict the Houses of the students described in _dataset_test.csv_.
